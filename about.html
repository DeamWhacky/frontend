    <h1>You have reached the about section!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm sam and im the author of this page. I'm interested in web development and i will become really skilled at this
      one day. <strong>small steps</strong>. i havent been the most disciplined but recently i have made some good
      habits. i still have time and i will use it efficiently and well. this is my final year and this will change the
      course of my life. i just hope i get some good influence. everyone around me seems to not care about their careers
      at all. i just realised im supposed to learn html and not make a journal of my life. time to go.

      ps it feels weird thinking that this page, if im ever to deploy it online, will probably be wandering across the
      digital plains like an ancient city thats buried underground, never to be found. if anyone does see this, like a
      thousand years from now, or 5, know that im here and im asking the same question -
      <em>why are we here in the first place?</em>
