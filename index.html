      HUGE PRETTIER ISSUE!!!
      <br />
      <br />installed prettier last day, thinking it was a cool formatter, turns out it puts trailing slashes in void
      elements which isnt the standard of html5 anymore, wasted a lot of time trying to find a fix. eventually decided
      to use the default html features formatter for html files and prettier for the rest. works fine so far. w3c
      service validation brings up no errors.
      <br />
      <br />p.s. the default formatter has line breaking issues; went back to prettier, just have to be used to the
      fucking trailing slash
